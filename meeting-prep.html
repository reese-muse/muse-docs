<h1>Silverback Strategies Evaluation</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Meeting Prep Document - Muse Paintbar</p>
<p class="dateline">February 2026</p>

<div style="background: #CEF2E9; border: 2px solid #0094F9; border-radius: 6px; padding: 20px 24px; margin-bottom: 28pt;">
<h2 style="border-bottom: none; margin-top: 0; padding-bottom: 0; font-size: 15pt; color: #004480;">TALKING POINTS</h2>

<p><strong>1. Open with acknowledgment:</strong><br>
"Paid media is working. CPA is down 13%, volume is up, the channel reallocation is smart. We want to keep that relationship strong."</p>

<p><strong>2. Frame the SEO problem:</strong><br>
"At $90K/year, we're paying for advisory work - content outlines, PageSpeed screenshots, keyword tracking. Our team writes every blog, implements every fix. Multiple SOW deliverables are missing: no CTR analysis, no CRO testing, one competitor audit in 18 months, structured data that was never deployed. We need the retainer to reflect the actual scope of work."</p>

<p><strong>3. Hit the organic growth number:</strong><br>
"The Annual Review claims 29% organic growth. But your own dashboard shows you cut branded Google Ads by 96% - from $28,600 to $1,200/month. That traffic migrated to organic in GA4. When you strip that out, organic sessions are only up 3.2% YoY. That's $90K for 3% growth."</p>

<p><strong>4. The local gap:</strong><br>
"We have 20+ locations and zero Google Business Profile optimization, zero Yelp strategy, zero TripAdvisor management. For a multi-location entertainment business, that's the highest-impact SEO work - and it's completely absent."</p>

<p><strong>5. The ask:</strong><br>
"We want to renegotiate SEO from $7,500 to $2,500&ndash;$3,500/month. We'd also like a detailed hours breakdown for the last quarter, and a clear answer on which SOW deliverables are actually being produced."</p>

<p><strong>6. If they push back:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><em>"Rankings take time"</em> &rarr; "You've had 20 months. National terms haven't moved. Location terms were likely strong before you started."</li>
    <li><em>"Organic revenue is up 29%"</em> &rarr; "After adjusting for the branded search cut, real organic growth is ~3%. We have the dashboard data."</li>
    <li><em>"We provide strategic value"</em> &rarr; "Strategy without execution is a to-do list. Your own competitor audit recommendations took 16 months to act on."</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>

<p>Muse Paintbar pays Silverback Strategies approximately <strong>$262,000/year</strong> across four service lines:</p>

<table>
    <tr><th>Service</th><th>Monthly</th><th>Annual</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Paid Media Management</td><td>$10,000</td><td>$120,000</td></tr>
    <tr><td>SEO</td><td>$7,500</td><td>$90,000</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Analytics</td><td>$1,000</td><td>$12,000</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Creative Strategy</td><td>$3,333 ($10K/quarter)</td><td>$40,000</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>TOTAL</strong></td><td><strong>~$21,833</strong></td><td><strong>~$262,000</strong></td></tr>
</table>

<div class="callout">
    <strong>Bottom line:</strong> Paid media management is performing well and appears worth the spend. SEO is significantly overpriced for what's being delivered - the work product is largely advisory templates that your internal team implements. Creative strategy was downgraded from production to "concepts only" but still costs $10K/quarter.
</div>

<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Keep paid media. Renegotiate SEO from $7,500/month down to $2,500&ndash;$3,500/month, or replace with a combination of AI tools and a junior SEO contractor. Evaluate whether creative strategy at $10K/quarter is justified for 10 concept ideas and one call.</p>

<h2>SECTION 1: SOW vs. ACTUAL DELIVERABLES</h2>
<p><em>SEO - $7,500/month</em></p>

<h3>Delivered (with caveats)</h3>

<table>
    <tr><th>SOW Promise</th><th>What's Actually Happening</th><th>Grade</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Technical SEO Monitoring</td><td>CWV audit delivered Jan 2026 - but it's PageSpeed Insights screenshots with links to Google's own documentation. No custom analysis.</td><td class="grade">C-</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Keyword Research &amp; Tracking</td><td>~50 tracked keywords showing strong location rankings (#1 for most "[city] paint and sip" terms). National terms weak (#20 for "paint and sip").</td><td class="grade">B-</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Content Strategy</td><td>3 content briefs/month with proper SEO structure. Competent but formulaic.</td><td class="grade">B-</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Monthly Reporting</td><td>January 2026 report covers revenue, paid media, and organic at a high level. SEO section is thin on strategic depth.</td><td class="grade">C+</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Quarterly Editorial Calendar</td><td>Content briefs suggest this exists, though the calendar itself hasn't been shared.</td><td class="grade">B (assumed)</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Not Delivered or No Evidence</h3>

<table>
    <tr><th>SOW Promise</th><th>Status</th></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Structured Data Implementation</strong></td><td>FAQ schema was produced for 6 pages in a spreadsheet, but was never implemented on the site. Uses FAQPage schema type that Google has been deprioritizing since 2023. Copy-paste quality issues (duplicate questions on same page). 20+ location pages and other key pages have no structured data at all.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>CTR Analysis</strong></td><td>No click-through rate analysis has been shared. Promised quarterly.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Testing Calendar</strong></td><td>No A/B testing calendar or CRO tests despite a detailed CRO proposal in Year 1 review projecting $789K incremental revenue.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Competitor &amp; SERP Analyses</strong></td><td>One competitor audit was delivered in Oct 2024 (4 months into engagement). No follow-up since. The audit identified key opportunities (Date Night, Girls Night, city "things to do" content) that took 16 months and $120K in SEO fees to begin acting on. No backlink analysis, no technical comparison, no ongoing competitive monitoring.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>3 Month Rolling Plan</strong></td><td>No forward-looking strategic roadmap shared.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Content Production (5-15 assets/quarter)</strong></td><td>Only outlines provided. Muse's internal marketing team writes all blog content. Bhavesh publishes. Silverback produces zero finished content.</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>The "Advisory-Only" Problem</h3>

<p>Every Silverback SEO deliverable requires your team to do the actual work:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>CWV Audit</strong> &rarr; Bhavesh implements all fixes</li>
    <li><strong>Content Briefs</strong> &rarr; Your marketing team writes the blogs, Bhavesh publishes</li>
    <li><strong>Local Citations</strong> &rarr; Someone on your team would need to claim/update 163 listings</li>
    <li><strong>Technical Recommendations</strong> &rarr; Bhavesh implements</li>
</ul>

<p>You're paying $7,500/month for a team that identifies issues using free tools (PageSpeed Insights, Google Search Console, SEMrush) and hands you a to-do list. The question is whether that advisory function alone is worth $90K/year.</p>

<h2>SECTION 2: REVENUE BY CHANNEL &amp; THE ORGANIC REALITY</h2>

<p><em>From Silverback's own Marketing Dashboard (Supermetrics / GA4) - January 2026</em></p>

<table>
    <tr><th>Channel</th><th>Sessions</th><th>Purchases</th><th>Revenue</th><th>% of Revenue</th></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Organic Search</strong></td><td>121,112</td><td>5,787</td><td>$674,065</td><td>40.4%</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Paid Search</strong></td><td>90,497</td><td>4,665</td><td>$443,480</td><td>26.6%</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Direct</strong></td><td>126,939</td><td>4,755</td><td>$297,292</td><td>17.8%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Cross-network</td><td>29,685</td><td>1,112</td><td>$114,631</td><td>6.9%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Paid Social</td><td>68,085</td><td>398</td><td>$40,501</td><td>2.4%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Referral</td><td>5,687</td><td>279</td><td>$37,596</td><td>2.3%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Organic Social</td><td>13,525</td><td>238</td><td>$21,354</td><td>1.3%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Email</td><td>10,150</td><td>204</td><td>$17,751</td><td>1.1%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Organic Shopping</td><td>520</td><td>28</td><td>$17,550</td><td>1.1%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>SMS + Other</td><td>2,419</td><td>84</td><td>$5,104</td><td>0.3%</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>TOTAL</strong></td><td><strong>468,619</strong></td><td><strong>17,550</strong></td><td><strong>$1,669,324</strong></td><td><strong>100%</strong></td></tr>
</table>

<div class="callout">
    <strong>Why this matters for the Silverback conversation:</strong> Organic Search is the #1 revenue channel at 40.4% ($674K/month). But a significant portion of this "organic growth" is inflated by Silverback's own decision to cut branded Google Ads spend by 96% ($28.6K &rarr; $1.2K YoY). When you stop paying for branded search ads, that traffic doesn't disappear - it shows up as "organic." This directly undermines Silverback's Annual Review claim that organic revenue grew 29% ($560K) due to their SEO work.
</div>

<h3>Organic Sessions Monthly Trend (2025&ndash;2026)</h3>
<table>
    <tr><th>Month</th><th>Organic Sessions</th><th>Note</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Feb 2025</td><td>106,557</td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td>Mar 2025</td><td>102,755</td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td>Apr 2025</td><td>88,736</td><td>Seasonal dip</td></tr>
    <tr><td>May 2025</td><td>80,567</td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td>Jun 2025</td><td>78,230</td><td>Summer trough</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Jul 2025</td><td>82,189</td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td>Aug 2025</td><td>89,037</td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td>Sep 2025</td><td>89,891</td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td>Oct 2025</td><td>90,446</td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td>Nov 2025</td><td>91,899</td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td>Dec 2025</td><td>98,652</td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td>Jan 2026</td><td>109,927</td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Feb 2026 (partial)</strong></td><td><strong>105,762</strong></td><td>On pace</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Organic sessions show a clear seasonal pattern (dips in summer, peaks in Q1/Q4) and a slow upward trend from the Jun 2025 trough of 78K. But Jan 2026 (109,927) is barely above Feb 2025 (106,557) - just +3.2% YoY. Given $90K/year in SEO fees, plus the branded search reallocation tailwind, this is modest growth at best.</p>

<h2>SECTION 3: SEO PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS</h2>

<h3>Keyword Rankings (Feb 2026)</h3>

<p><strong>Strong - Location Terms:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>"paint and sip nyc" &rarr; #1 (5,400 monthly searches)</li>
    <li>"paint and sip boston" &rarr; #1 (1,000 monthly searches)</li>
    <li>Most "[city] paint and sip" variants &rarr; #1 or top 3</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Weak - National/High-Volume Terms:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>"paint and sip" &rarr; #20 (40,500 monthly searches)</li>
    <li>"sip and paint" &rarr; #36 (22,200 monthly searches)</li>
    <li>"wine and paint" &rarr; #10 (4,400 monthly searches)</li>
    <li>"paint party" &rarr; #14 (5,400 monthly searches)</li>
</ul>

<p>The location rankings are strong, but many were likely already ranking well before Silverback. The high-volume national terms - where the real growth opportunity lives - are weak and show no clear trajectory of improvement.</p>

<h3>Organic Traffic (Jan&ndash;Feb 2026 vs. 2025)</h3>

<table>
    <tr><th>Metric</th><th>YoY Change</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Organic Sessions</td><td>+10%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Organic Purchases</td><td>+4.2%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Blog Traffic</td><td>+2,562% (from ~32 to ~852 sessions)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>ChatGPT Sessions</td><td>798 (+41% period-over-period)</td></tr>
</table>

<div class="callout">
    <strong>Key insight:</strong> The overall business grew revenue +7% YoY. Organic purchase growth of +4.2% is <em>below</em> the business average, meaning SEO is underperforming relative to other channels.
</div>

<h3>Location-Level Performance (Jan 1 &ndash; Feb 16, 2026 vs. 2025)</h3>

<p><strong>Winners:</strong> Arlington (+30.9% sessions), Milford (+29.8%), Atlanta (+19.1%), DC (+16.8%)</p>
<p><strong>Losers:</strong> Portland ME (-19.1% sessions), Foxborough (-15.6% purchases), Virginia Beach (-2.3%)</p>
<p>Overall: ~7% session growth, ~17% purchase growth across locations - decent but not exceptional.</p>

<h3>Blog Traffic Reality Check</h3>
<p>The +2,562% YoY blog traffic number is misleading:</p>
<ul>
    <li>In absolute terms, that's approximately +820 sessions</li>
    <li>Blog traffic is still a tiny fraction of total organic sessions (112,835)</li>
    <li>Your team writes the blogs, not Silverback</li>
</ul>

<h2>SECTION 4: DELIVERABLE DEEP DIVES</h2>

<h3>Local Citation Recommendations (Nov 2025)</h3>
<p><strong>What was delivered:</strong> A spreadsheet with 163 rows of citation recommendations across 21 locations.</p>
<p><strong>The problem:</strong> Over 50% of the rows are copy-paste filler. The same 4 platforms (Eventbrite, Meetup, Peerspace, PartySlate) are repeated identically for every location. No implementation tracking, no prioritization, no status columns.</p>
<p><strong>What this should have been:</strong> A prioritized list of high-impact citations per location with claimed/unclaimed status, NAP consistency audit, and an implementation timeline.</p>

<h3>Core Web Vitals Audit (Jan 2026)</h3>
<p><strong>What was delivered:</strong> Three documents:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A 20-page PDF of PageSpeed Insights screenshots for 11 pages</li>
    <li>A spreadsheet listing unused JS, unused CSS, and minification opportunities</li>
    <li>A tracking sheet with "before" scores and completely empty "after" columns</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The problem:</strong> This is a copy-paste from Google's free PageSpeed Insights tool. The PDF literally contains screenshots of the tool's output with links to Google's generic documentation articles. Any developer (or AI tool) can run PageSpeed Insights in 5 minutes.</p>

<table>
    <tr><th>Metric</th><th>Status</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Before scores (mobile)</td><td>Range from 27&ndash;58 (poor to needs improvement)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>After scores</td><td>Completely empty. No follow-up or results tracking.</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Content Briefs (Feb 2026)</h3>
<p><strong>What was delivered:</strong> 3 blog outlines targeting:</p>
<ul>
    <li>"8 Best Things to Do in National Harbor, MD" (2,900 MSV)</li>
    <li>"6 Creative and Fun Girls' Night Ideas" (1,900 MSV)</li>
    <li>"6 Unique Date Night Ideas in Virginia Beach, VA" (320 MSV)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Quality:</strong> Competent. Proper keyword targeting, logical H2/H3 structure, internal linking suggestions, reasonable meta descriptions. These follow standard SEO content brief templates.</p>
<p><strong>The problem:</strong> These are outlines, not content. Your team writes every word. The brief format is highly templatable - AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, SurferSEO, or Clearscope can generate equivalent briefs in minutes for a fraction of the cost.</p>

<h3>Competitor Audit (Oct 2024)</h3>
<p><strong>What was delivered:</strong> A 20-slide presentation analyzing 3 competitors: Painting with a Twist (44.8K keywords, 322K traffic), Paint Nite (21.3K keywords, 59K traffic), and The Escape Game (48.2K keywords, 240K traffic). Identified functional page opportunities (Date Night, Girls Night, DIY, Family), blog content strategies, and UX elements to emulate.</p>
<p><strong>What's useful:</strong> The audit correctly identified that Painting with a Twist gets 3.3x more organic traffic than Muse and pinpointed specific content gaps - Date Night pages, Girls Night content, city-specific "things to do" blogs, and customer testimonials on location pages.</p>
<p><strong>The problems:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>One-and-done:</strong> Delivered Oct 2024, no follow-up in 16 months. SOW promises ongoing competitive analysis.</li>
    <li><strong>Glacial execution on their own recommendations:</strong> The Feb 2026 content briefs ("Girls Night Ideas," "Date Night Ideas in Virginia Beach") are <em>finally</em> addressing opportunities identified in Oct 2024. That's $120,000 in SEO fees between identifying the opportunity and beginning to act on it.</li>
    <li><strong>Irrelevant competitor included:</strong> The Escape Game is an escape room company, not a paint-and-sip competitor. Including it pads the deck but dilutes competitive focus.</li>
    <li><strong>No depth beyond SEMrush exports:</strong> Missing backlink comparison, technical SEO comparison, content velocity analysis, conversion path comparison, review/social benchmarking, and keyword gap analysis.</li>
    <li><strong>Vague recommendations:</strong> Every section ends with "Muse should consider emulating this page" - no prioritization, no projected impact, no implementation timeline.</li>
</ul>

<h3>FAQ Structured Data (Undated)</h3>
<p><strong>What was delivered:</strong> A spreadsheet with pre-written JSON-LD FAQ schema for 6 pages: Public Events, Private Events, On-Site Events, Virtual Events, Birthdays, and Kids Parties.</p>
<p><strong>What's useful:</strong> The schema code is properly formatted and ready to implement. This is the structured data work promised in the SOW.</p>
<p><strong>The problems:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Never implemented:</strong> The code sits in a spreadsheet. It was never deployed to the site - another handoff for Bhavesh.</li>
    <li><strong>Only 6 pages:</strong> Your site has 20+ location pages, a shop subdomain, and many other pages that could benefit from structured data (Event, LocalBusiness, Organization schemas).</li>
    <li><strong>Copy-paste quality issues:</strong> The Birthdays and Kids Parties pages share ~80% identical FAQ content. The Birthdays page has a duplicate - "What about Food and Drinks?" AND "What about Food &amp; Drinks?" as two separate questions.</li>
    <li><strong>FAQPage schema is losing value:</strong> Google has been deprioritizing FAQ rich results since 2023, now only showing them for authoritative government and health sites. This is one of the least impactful schema types they could have chosen.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Asana Thread (Paul Mahoney's Responses)</h3>
<p>When your team shared SEO educational YouTube videos, Paul's responses were notably defensive and reactive rather than proactive:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Backlink strategy was only addressed after being prompted by your team's video shares</li>
    <li>Acknowledged competitor analysis was overdue</li>
    <li>Responses suggest a reactive posture - explaining why things haven't been done rather than driving strategy forward</li>
</ul>

<h2>SECTION 5: THE LOCAL PLATFORM GAP</h2>
<p><em>The biggest missing piece in Silverback's SEO program</em></p>

<p>Muse Paintbar operates <strong>20+ physical locations</strong> across the East Coast. For a multi-location business, local platform optimization is arguably the highest-impact SEO activity - it directly drives the Google Map Pack, Yelp discovery, and booking conversions. <strong>There is zero evidence Silverback is managing or advising on any of these platforms.</strong></p>

<h3>Google Business Profile (GBP) - Not Being Managed</h3>
<p>GBP is the #1 local SEO channel. It controls Map Pack rankings, drives calls/website clicks/direction requests, and is the first thing customers see for local searches. For 20+ locations, ongoing GBP management should include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Regular Google Posts (events, promotions, seasonal paintings, new offerings)</li>
    <li>Photo and video uploads per location</li>
    <li>Q&amp;A monitoring and proactive FAQ seeding</li>
    <li>Review response strategy and templates</li>
    <li>Category, attribute, and service optimization per location</li>
    <li>Hours updates (holidays, special events, seasonal changes)</li>
    <li>GBP performance reporting per location (impressions, clicks, calls, direction requests)</li>
    <li>Competitor GBP benchmarking</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Evidence from Silverback: None.</strong> No GBP strategy, no GBP metrics in monthly reports, no posting calendar, no review management plan.</p>

<h3>Yelp - Not Being Managed (Despite Active Spend)</h3>
<p>Yelp is especially relevant for Muse because paint-and-sip sits at the intersection of entertainment + food/drink - exactly where Yelp has the strongest user intent. Yelp pages also rank on Google page 1 for "[city] paint and sip" searches.</p>
<p><strong>The spend reality:</strong> Muse was paying <strong>$3,650&ndash;$4,650/month</strong> on Yelp ads through Oct 2024 (~$44K/year), reduced to <strong>$720/month</strong> in Nov 2024. Even at reduced spend, Yelp organic presence across 20+ locations is completely unmanaged. For 20+ locations, Yelp management should include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Optimized business descriptions with local keywords</li>
    <li>Professional photo management per location</li>
    <li>Review monitoring and response strategy</li>
    <li>Yelp Deals or Check-in Offers to drive foot traffic</li>
    <li>Yelp Connect posts (Yelp's equivalent of Google Posts)</li>
    <li>Category optimization</li>
    <li>Tracking Yelp as a referral source in analytics</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Evidence from Silverback: None.</strong></p>

<h3>Other Platforms Being Ignored</h3>
<table>
    <tr><th>Platform</th><th>Relevance to Muse</th><th>Status</th></tr>
    <tr><td>TripAdvisor</td><td>High - tourist locations (DC, NYC, Nashville, Virginia Beach)</td><td>No evidence of management</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Apple Business Connect</td><td>Medium - growing share of local search on iOS</td><td>No evidence of management</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Facebook/Instagram Business</td><td>Medium - business listings, local events, reviews</td><td>No evidence of management</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Eventbrite</td><td>Medium - event discovery (listed in citation audit but no strategy)</td><td>Recommended but not managed</td></tr>
</table>

<div class="callout">
    <strong>Key point:</strong> Silverback's local citation audit recommended listing on Eventbrite, Meetup, Peerspace, and PartySlate - the same 4 platforms copy-pasted across every location - but completely ignored active optimization of the platforms that actually drive bookings: Google Business Profile, Yelp, and TripAdvisor. For $90K/year in SEO on a multi-location entertainment business, local platform management should be core, not absent.
</div>

<h2>SECTION 6: PAID MEDIA ASSESSMENT</h2>

<div class="callout">
    <strong>Assessment: B+</strong> - Paid media is delivering measurable, efficient results. CPA declining while volume grows. The strategic reallocation from branded search (-96%) to non-brand Google (+49%) and Meta prospecting (+52%) shows real strategic thinking - branded search captures existing demand while non-brand and prospecting drive net new customers. <strong>Important caveat: this reallocation is the primary driver of "organic growth" in the SEO metrics, since branded search traffic now shows as organic in GA4.</strong>

<h2>SECTION 7: ANNUAL REVIEW CLAIMS vs. REALITY</h2>
<p>From the June 2025 Year 1 Annual Review:</p>

<table>
    <tr><th>Claim</th><th>Reality Check</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Organic revenue up 29% YoY ($560K)</td><td><strong>Directly inflated by Silverback's own branded search cut.</strong> Their dashboard shows Google Brand Ad spend went from $28,588/month (Jan 2025) to $1,184/month (Jan 2026) - a 96% reduction. That ~$27K/month in branded search traffic didn't disappear; it migrated to "organic" in GA4 attribution. This is a smart paid media decision, but claiming the resulting organic lift as an SEO win is misleading.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Revenue vs. Goal: Exceeded</td><td>Actually missed goal in 4 of 6 months (Jan-8%, Mar -4%, Apr -9%, May -7%). Only Feb (+10%) and Jun (+15%) beat targets.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>CRO to generate $789K incremental revenue</td><td>No evidence of CRO testing being implemented. No A/B test results shared. This projection remains theoretical.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Meta iCAC down 83%</td><td>Legitimate - Meta scaling has been effective. Credit to paid media team.</td></tr>

<h2>SECTION 8: QUESTIONS TO ASK IN THE MEETING</h2>

<h3>SEO Accountability</h3>
<ol>
    <li>"The SOW promises structured data implementation. What schema markup has been added to our site in the past 12 months?"</li>
    <li>"The SOW promises CTR analysis. Can you share the last quarterly CTR report?"</li>
    <li>"The SOW promises competitor and SERP analyses. When will we see a competitive audit?"</li>
    <li>"The SOW promises a testing calendar. The Year 1 review proposed CRO testing with $789K projected revenue. What tests have been run?"</li>
    <li>"The CWV tracking sheet has empty 'after' columns. What's the timeline for measuring impact?"</li>
</ol>

<h3>Local Platform &amp; GBP</h3>
<ol start="6">
    <li>"We have 20+ Google Business Profiles. What GBP optimization work has Silverback done? What's the posting strategy? Can you show us GBP performance metrics by location?"</li>
    <li>"What is our Yelp optimization strategy across locations? Are we monitoring and responding to reviews? Running any Yelp Deals or Yelp Connect posts?"</li>
    <li>"The competitor audit from Oct 2024 noted The Escape Game uses customer testimonials on location pages and has strong GBP reviews. What's been done to improve our local presence on these platforms?"</li>
</ol>

<h3>Value &amp; Attribution</h3>
<ol start="9">
    <li>"The Annual Review claims 29% organic revenue growth. But your own dashboard shows you cut branded Google Ads from $28,600/month to $1,200/month - a 96% reduction. How much of that 'organic growth' is just branded search traffic migrating from paid to organic in GA4?"</li>
    <li>"Our organic purchases grew 4.2% YoY while the business grew 7%. What's your plan to accelerate organic growth?"</li>
    <li>"Organic sessions in Jan 2026 (109,927) are only 3.2% above Feb 2025 (106,557). After $90K in SEO fees, what's the organic growth story when you strip out the branded search migration?"</li>
    <li>"We rank #20 for 'paint and sip' (40,500 monthly searches). What's the specific strategy and timeline to crack the top 10?"</li>
    <li>"Blog traffic grew 2,562% but that's ~820 sessions. What's the realistic timeline to make blog content a meaningful traffic driver?"</li>
    <li>"Our internal team writes all blog content from your outlines. What's the justification for the content strategy portion of the $7,500/month?"</li>
</ol>

<h3>Execution Speed</h3>
<ol start="15">
    <li>"The Oct 2024 competitor audit recommended Date Night and Girls Night content. The first content briefs targeting these topics arrived in Feb 2026 - 16 months later. Why did it take over a year to begin acting on your own recommendations?"</li>
</ol>

<h3>Forward-Looking</h3>
<ol start="16">
    <li>"What would change about deliverables and reporting if we reduced the SEO retainer to $3,500/month?"</li>
    <li>"Can you provide a detailed breakdown of hours spent on our SEO account per month for the last quarter?"</li>
    <li>"The Year 2 SOW promises 5-15 content assets per quarter. How many finished assets has Silverback produced (not outlines)?"</li>
</ol>

<h2>SECTION 9: RECOMMENDATION</h2>

<h3>Tier 1: Keep As-Is</h3>
<p><strong>Paid Media ($10,000/month):</strong> Performance justifies the spend. CPA declining, volume growing, strategic channel optimization is evident.</p>

<h3>Tier 2: Renegotiate Significantly</h3>
<p><strong>SEO ($7,500/month &rarr; $2,500&ndash;$3,500/month):</strong> The current deliverables do not justify $90K/year. A reduced retainer reflecting the actual advisory workload would be fair. Alternatively, explore replacing with:</p>
<ul>
    <li>AI tools for content briefs (Claude, SurferSEO, Clearscope): ~$200-500/month</li>
    <li>A freelance SEO strategist for monthly audits and keyword research: ~$2,000-3,000/month</li>
    <li>PageSpeed Insights and Google Search Console (free) for technical monitoring</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tier 3: Evaluate</h3>
<p><strong>Analytics ($1,000/month):</strong> Low cost but unclear value. What exactly is delivered for $12K/year?</p>
<p><strong>Creative Strategy ($10,000/quarter):</strong> Downgraded from production to concepts only. Ten ideas and one call per quarter for $10K warrants scrutiny.</p>

<h3>Potential Annual Savings</h3>

    <tr><td>Renegotiate SEO to $3,500/month</td><td>$214,000</td><td>$48,000</td></tr>
